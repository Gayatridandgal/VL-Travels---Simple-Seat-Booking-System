## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### **1. Prerequisites**

cd vl-travels
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
Run the following command to install the required packages:
```bash
npm install
```

### **4. Set Up the Database**
- Open your MySQL client and run the following SQL commands to create the database and table:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE travel;

USE travel;

CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    custname VARCHAR(255),
    contact VARCHAR(15),
    seats INT,
    totalPrice DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

### **5. Update Database Configuration**
Ensure the database credentials in `index.js` match your MySQL configuration:
```javascript
const con = mysql.createConnection({
    host: "127.0.0.1",
    user: "your-username",
    password: "your-password",
    database: "travel"
});
```
